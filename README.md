# MKS21X-FinalProject
DAILY LOG:
Jan 3rd, 2018:
We created the repo today and also began two branches, one called ClassStructure by Tejas
The other is mainMethod by Alma. Tomorrow we plan to refine these branches and begin
Caesar cipher.
-wiifit

Jan 6, 2018:
The class structure for the ciphers is laid out as far as necessary. Abstract classes are
complete - branch ClassStructure has been merged. Will take out a branch soon to work
on a random simple substitution cipher. Caesar cipher will follow.
ALMA: finished the mainMethod and switched all if/then statements to switch statements
Further clarified class structure
-wiifit

Jan 7, 2018:
We realized errors in out class structure in class, so we are adding constructors
to each abstract class and then will start writing the actual methods

NIGHT UPDATE: started substitution cipher, having trouble with random jumbling of letters but shiftKey works fine --alma

Jan 8, 2018:
Tejas fixes super conflicts
Alma wrote substitutioncipher and caesar cipher, will have to adjust them according to new class structure

Jan 9, 2018:
Tejas beings on vignere cipher
alma adjust substitution and caesar

jan 10, 2018:
tejas finishes vignere
alma begins bookcipher, runtime very very slow. has to look into using string instead of arraLyist to hold data perhas
or for quicker way to scan through very long list of chars. difficult

jan 11, 2018:
alma fixes slow runtime for bookcipher. The problem was actually how the ciphertext 
was being processed and there was an infinite loop as adding '-1' meant 1 kept being
procdssed over and over
