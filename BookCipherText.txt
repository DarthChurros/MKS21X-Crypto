HELLO HOW ARE YOU IT IS BEST TO USE FILES WITH ALL CAPITALS AND NO PUNCTUATION ALTHOUGHT THE 
PUNCTUATION MAY BE REMOVED. I AM JUST GOING TO FILL UP THIS PARAGRAPH WITH RANDOM WORDS!! AND 
EASILY TEST MY BOOKCIPHER. REALLY IT IS OUR BOOK CIPHER. JUST TO ADD SOME LESSER USED WORDS, LET'S HAVE:
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG. AND HARMONICAS AND HARPS THE MUSIC ROOM IS FILLED WITH SOME 
COOOOOOOL INSTRUMENTS! TO ADD ANOTHER 'Z', WELL I JUST ADDED ONE! NOW THE PUNCTUATION IS ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT
THAT IS O.K -- I AM GOING TO TURN ALL THIS TEXT INTO ONE BIG CHAR ARRAY, AND WHEN CREATING THE ARRAY I WILL
BAR ENTRY OF ANY PUNCTUATION. LET'S GET SOME QS: THE QUEEN QUICKLY CARRIED ON HER DUTIES, QUINTESSENTIALLY EXEMPLIFYING
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A QUEEN. ALSO Z AND U AND Y AND X! MAYBE ALL X WILL HAVE TO STEM FROM THESE TWO SENTENCES. XYLOPHONE
AND LED ZEPPLIN AND ZACHARY TAYLOR, A PRETTY WIMPY PRESIDENT WHO BENDED OVER FOR MANIFEST DESTINY, TRIED TO GET TEXAS
INTO THE US FOR POLITICAL POINTS ONLY TO FURTHER REEL IN THE IMPENDING DOOM OF ABOLISHING SLAVERY! THEN IN KANSAS THERE 
WAS JOHN BROWN WHO CUT OFF THE HANDS OF MISSOURIANS WHO JUMPED THE BORDER, VOTED IN THE ELECTIONS, AND FRAUDULENTLY 
MADE KANSAS A SLAVE STATE. WHO SAID KANSAS COULD DECIDE? STEPHEN A. DOUGLASS FROM ILLINOIS (?) DID. OR MAYBE HE WAS
FROM OHIO. NO HE WAS IN ILLINOIS BECAUSE HIM AND THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD THEIR LINCOLN-DOUGLASS
DEBATES ALL OVER ILLINOIS. STEPHEN A. DOUGLASS WANTED THE RAILROAD TO RUN THROUGH HIS STATE, TO DO SO HE NEEDED TO OPEN
KANSAS FOR SETTLEMENT SO THERE WAS REASON TO BUILD THE RAILROAD. BUT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COULD NOT COME TO CONSENSUS
ON WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE A SLAVE STATE. SO IT WAS UP TO THOSE WHO SETTLED IT! BUT PEOPLE ONLY 'SETTLED' IT, AND THOSE 
WHO 'SETTLED' OUTNUMBERED THOSE WHO SETTLED AND SWAYED THE ELECTIONS TO ALLOW FOR SLAVERY.
